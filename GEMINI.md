# Gemini Context: Personal Study Repository

## Directory Overview

This directory, `C:\KKS\Dev\Projects\Study`, is a personal repository for programming practice and learning. It contains a collection of source code, exercises, and solutions related to various programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. The repository is organized by programming language and topic.

## Key Directories

- **`0-CodingTest/`**: Contains solutions and practice code for common algorithm problems found in coding tests. It is further subdivided by language (Python, C++).
- **`C_CPP/`**: Holds C and C++ language practice code, including beginner tutorials, exercises from books ("CPP\_하이킹"), and other examples.
- **`Java/`**: Contains Java practice projects, including beginner examples, exercises from the book "ThisIsJava", and Spring Boot applications.
- **`Python/`**: Includes Python language exercises, algorithm implementations, and beginner-level scripts.

## Usage and Conventions

- **Purpose**: This is a personal learning archive. Each subdirectory is largely self-contained and represents a specific book, tutorial, or concept.
- **Building and Running**: There are no global build or run commands. To work with the code:
  1.  Navigate to the specific subdirectory of interest (e.g., `0-CodingTest/Python/Everyone's-Algorithm-with-Python`).
  2.  Compile or run the files using the appropriate tools for that language (e.g., `python ex1-1_sum.py`, `gcc ex1-1.c -o output`, `javac MyClass.java`).
- **Dependencies**: Dependencies are likely not managed centrally. For specific projects like the Spring Boot applications in `Java/SpringBoot/`, dependency management files (e.g., `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`) should exist within those subdirectories.

CodingTest/: Study-CodingTest 저장소를 subtree로 관리하는 디렉토리
`CodingTest` 디렉토리는 `git subtree`로 관리되고 있으며, `Study-CodingTest` 저장소와 연결되어 있다. 변경사항 동기화는 `git subtree pull` 또는 `git subtree push` 명령을 사용한다.
